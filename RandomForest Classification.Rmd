## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
winequality=read.csv("winequalityN.csv")
winequality=winequality[complete.cases(winequality),] # removing the null values
# Assuming the quality greater than 6 as True and less than 6 as False
qual=ifelse(winequality$quality>6,"True","False")
# Adding the qual column to the winequality dataset
winequality=data.frame(winequality,qual)
table(winequality$qual)
# Deleting the unwanted columns quality and Type of wines
winequality=winequality[,-13]
winequality=winequality[,-1]
# Converting qual column into factor variable
winequality$qual=as.factor(winequality$qual)

# Dividing the sample data into train and test data
s=sample(nrow(winequality),0.8*nrow(winequality))
train_data=winequality[s,]
test_data=winequality[-s,]
# checking the dimensions(rows*columns)
dim(train_data)
dim(test_data)

# Performing Random Forest
fit=randomForest(qual~.,data=train_data)
print(fit)
# Error rate of random Forest
plot(fit)
# To identify lines in the Error rate plot 
str(fit$err.rate)
str(fit$err.rate[1,2]) # this gives the value of the error along with the type of quality of wine
str(fit$err.rate[1,3])

# Prediction and confusion matrix- train data
pred=predict(fit,train_data)
table(pred, train_data$qual)
confusionMatrix(pred,train_data$qual)

# Prediction and confusion matrix- test data
pred=predict(fit,test_data)
table(pred, test_data$qual)
confusionMatrix(pred,test_data$qual)

# Tuning mtry value
t<-tuneRF(train_data[,-12],train_data[,12],stepFactor=0.5, plot=TRUE, ntreeTry=300, trace=TRUE, improve=0.05)

fit=randomForest(qual~.,data=train_data, ntree=300, mtry=6, importance=TRUE, proximity=TRUE)
print(fit)
plot(fit)
 
# Prediction and confusion matrix- train data
pred=predict(fit,train_data)
table(pred, train_data$qual)
confusionMatrix(pred,train_data$qual)

# Prediction and confusion matrix- test data
pred=predict(fit,test_data)
table(pred, test_data$qual)
confusionMatrix(pred,test_data$qual)

# Variable Importance
varImpPlot(fit)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
